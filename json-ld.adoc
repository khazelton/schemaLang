Alasdair,

I've located the JSON-based Swagger doc I inquired about. Once again,
this brings discovery to the fore i.e., adopting any combination of the
following to aid structured data discovery:

1. <link/> in <head> via @rel -- xhv:alternate or xhv:related relations
where Swagger Doc URI identifies relation object

2. <script/> -- to embed metadata as structured data islands in HTML

3. Link: -- at the HTTP level emulating #1.

Currently, you have <https://dev.openphacts.org/docs/2.1>, and a
validation icon that anchored by the URI
<https://online.swagger.io/validator/debug?url=https://dev.openphacts.org/swagger/spec/ops_2_1.json>,
from which I can discern the Swagger Docs URI
<https://dev.openphacts.org/swagger/spec/ops_2_1.json> .

I can transform content of
<https://dev.openphacts.org/swagger/spec/ops_2_1.json> into 5-Star
Linked Data via the URI:

<http://linkeddata.uriburner.com/about/html/https://dev.openphacts.org/swagger/spec/ops_2_1.json>

I can pivot to an alternative Faceted Browsing View using
<http://linkeddata.uriburner.com/describe/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flinkeddata.uriburner.com%2Fabout%2Fid%2Fentity%2Fhttps%2Fdev.openphacts.org%2Fswagger%2Fspec%2Fops_2_1.json>


And then look at the description of a specific Action using

<http://linkeddata.uriburner.com/describe/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flinkeddata.uriburner.com%2Fabout%2Fid%2Fentity%2Fhttps%2Fdev.openphacts.org%2Fswagger%2Fspec%2Fops_2_1.json%23~%252Fcompound~get&distinct=1>

Conclusion:

We just need to enhance structured data discoverability using existing
open standards and best practices. The REST will come together naturally
because the Web has great underlying architectural design :)
